# Developing-Python-Classes

### Project Objectives

- Development of a Python class for automatically checking linear regression assumptions.
  
- Creation of a second Python class for running various machine learning algorithms to identify the best performing models pre-hyperparameter tuning.
  
### Methodology

Employed Python, leveraging libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib, to develop these classes. The focus was on creating user-friendly and flexible tools that cater to both novice and experienced data scientists.Methodlogy steps include:

- Literature review

- Linear regression assumption class development

- Model selection class development incoporating algorithms like linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, elastic net, principal component analysis (PCA), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), decison treee,boosting, Xgboost, neural networks.

- Experiment and result analysis
  
### Conclusion

Current limitations include the scope of regression checks and the range of included machine learning models. Future enhancements could involve expanding these aspects and adding more customization options to cater to a broader range of analytical needs.
